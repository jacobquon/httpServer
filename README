Description:
This is a static simple web (HTTP 1.1) server that is is run through command line. 
It accepts GET and HEAD requests from a web browser and uses a thread pool to invoke 
a worker thread which processes the request. 

The request is paresed and the worker thread returns either the file or a listing
of files in a directory depending on whether a file or a directory was requested.
It supports the following mime types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, text/plain, 
text/html, and video/mp4.

Security measures were implemented to ensure users could not access files outside
the root directory.

There are 2 special URLs: /shutdown and /control. /shutdown shuts down the server
immediately, making sure to properly abort threads currently handling requests.
/control returns a control panel which contains my name and pennID, a list of all
threads in the pool and their statuses, and a button that shuts down the server.

Instructions for Running:
	1. Compile the program by navigating to the directory and typing "mvn clean install"
	2. Run the created jar in target with the following parameters:
		1. Port to listen for connections on
		2. Root directory of the static web pages
